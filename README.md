# dogs-vs-cats
My implementation of a classifier for the dogs vs cats challenge using fast AI

By using the fastai library, I was able to implement a deep learning model and get an accuracy of about 99.3% whihc put me in the top 2 percent on the public leaderboard.

The code I used is in jupyter notebook.
